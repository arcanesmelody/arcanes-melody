	&nbsp;&nbsp;<h2>Artist Name: Peso Pluma or Hassan Emilio Kabande Laija </h2>
   <ul>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><strong>Themes:</strong>  Love and Heartbreak, Struggle and Resilience, Cultural Pride, Social issues, and personal growth </li>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <li><strong>Language:</strong>Spanish </li>
     <li><strong>Genre:</strong> Regional Mexican Music, corridos tumbados, urban sierreño, reggaeton, Latin trap, and EDM </li>
     <li><strong>Bio:</strong> Hassan Emilio Kabande Laija or Peso Pluma as his stage name has made a significant impact on the music scene with his unique blend of music. He archived moderate success
	 with his two albums named “Ah y Que?” (2020) and “Effectos Secundarios” (2021). His singles “Por Las Noches” and “El Belicon” (with Raul Vega) gained significant popularity. 
	 His breakthrough came with a collaboration with Natanael Cano, such as “AMG” and “PRC,” which became massive hits within the Latin music community, especially after their use on
	 Tick Tock. Lastly, his third album, “Genesis” (2023), won the Grammy Award for best Musica Mexicana Album (including Tejano). Peso Pluma is considered a major contributor to the revival 
	 of corridos and has a distinct musical style earning him a significant following. </li>
    <li><strong>Why I like them: </strong>I enjoy his music as it has brought me back to traditional music like the one, I grew up listening to as a child. I was not too aware of his music until I was in 
	Mexico 2022, I kept hearing the song from some relatives and others in the market listening to it. Thats when I got more interested in listening to his music and have been a listener 
	to him since. I unfortunately was not able to attend his 2023 concert, but I was able to attend his concert this year on October 5, 2024.  </li>
	</ul>

        <li><strong>Genre: </strong>Rapper, and singer </li>
        <li><strong>Bio:</strong> Nathan Feuerstein or NF as his stage name is a rapper, singer, and songwriter. NF started his music career independently, releasing his debut album “Moments in 2010.
		His breakthrough came with the album “Mansion” in 2015, followed by “Therapy Session” in 2016, which won the Gospel Music Association Dove Award for Rap/Hip Hop Album of the Year.
		NF’s music can be described as emotional, introspective, and raw. He incorporates elements of hip hop, pop, and Christian music, though he prefers not to be labeled strictly as a 
		Christian rapper.  </li>
       <li><strong>Why I like them: </strong>I personally was introduced to NF back in 2018 or 2019 give or take and it was through the song “Paralyzed” from the album Masion released in 2015. 
	   During this time, I was going through some rough spots of my own and his music really was like having an older brother going through something similar. </li>
    </ul>

	<h2>Artist Name: Chase Atlantic </h2>
    <ul>
	   <li><strong>Themes</strong>:  love, heartbreak, mental health, Addiction, and Escapism </li>
       <li><strong>Language: </strong>English<li> 
      <li> <strong>Genre: </strong>Alternative R&B, pop, and rock </li>
	  <li><strong>Bio:</strong> Chase Atlantic is an Australian band and production trio from Carins, Queensland, formed in 2014. The group consists of three members: Mitchel Cave, and Clinton Cave,
	  and Christian Anthony. Chase Atlantic had their breakthrough in 2017 with the release of their self-titled debut album, “Chase Atlantic.” With this album they showed their unique 
	  blend of alternative R&B, pop, and rock. This album helped their success to gain more popularity and solidify their place in the music industry. </li>
     <li><strong>Why I like them:</strong> I personally really enjoy their themes, and the instruments used in their music. Such as guitars, tenor saxophone, bass, and drums, the three of the artists
	 are vocalists and they tend to make their music a way to dreamily forget of worries. This year I was able to attend their concert on November 8th, 2024, and I really enjoyed it 
	 especially their new song in their new album “Lost in Heaven”.  </li>
