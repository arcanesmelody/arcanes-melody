		<h2>Coffee & Tea</h2>
            <p>Welcome to the Coffee & Tea section of Arcane’s Melody! Here, you’ll find reviews and 
			recommendations based on my personal experiences and preferences. I focus on sharing my 
			thoughts on my favorite Dunkin’ orders, other coffee drinks from cafes I’ve visited, 
			coffee creamers I’ve tried, and tea brands I’ve bought. Additionally, I’ll share some 
			brewing methods that I’ve experimented with and enjoyed.</p>

		<h2> Cold Brew Maker</h2>
		<p> I have a couple of coffee makers that I personally use, and some are more pleasant experiences to use and for the taste of the coffee and tea.  Recently, <br>
		I bought a Starbucks cold brew maker, which is perfect for making smooth, rich cold brew coffee at home. I ended up losing the instructions, but I found a helpful video to guide me.<br>
		Overall, I like the cold brew maker because you simply add the coffee grounds in the middle, put the filter on top, and the cap, which also serves as the opener for pouring coffee. <br>
		After adding the coarse coffee grounds and water, it’s best to shake it to help the coffee mix with the water, then let it sit in the fridge for 12-24 hours to enjoy smooth and <br>
		refreshing cold brew.  This method does take longer and can be tedious if you do not want to wait but it’s a good cup of Cold brew. </p>

		<h2> French Press</h2>
		<p> I also use a Frensch Press, a classic method of making coffee. You add coarse coffee grounds to the French press, add hot water, let it steep for about 4-5 minutes, then press<br>
		the plunger down slowly to ensure all the coffee grounds are taken to the bottom. This method is faster if you want to enjoy a warm cup of coffee, and if you can also make iced coffee<br>
		quickly without waiting as long as for a cold brew. I enjoy using my French press because it’s faster making a nice warm cup of coffee, especially in this cold water.  </p>

		<img src="images/POVM.jpg" alt="Image of a Pour over coffee maker." class="image-right">
		</div>
		
		
		<h2>Pour Over Coffee Maker</h2>
		<p> The pour-over coffee maker is a favorite among coffee enthusiasts because it produces a clean flavor. You can either grind beans for the best results or buy pre-grounded coffee.<br>
		Boil water to about 200F, place your filter in the dripper, and rinse it with hot water to remove any taste and preheat the dripper.  Add the coffee grounds (about 1-2 tablespoons <br>
		per 6 ounces of water) to the filter. Start by pouring a small amount of water over the ground to let them bloom for about 30 seconds. Then, slowly pour the rest of the water in a <br>
		circular motion, ensuring all the grounds are evenly saturated. </p>

		<img src="images/MP.jpg" alt="Image of a Moka Pot." class="image-right">
		</div>
		<h2> Moka Pot</h2>
		<p> Lastly, I use an espresso stovetop Coffee Maker (Moka Pot), an Italian method for making strong, espresso-like coffee at home. Fill the bottom chamber with water up to the safety valve.<br>
		After placing the filter, fill the basket with finely ground coffee, level it off without packing it, and screw the top chamber on tightly. Place the Moka pot on the stove over medium heat. <br>
		The water will boil and create pressure, pushing the coffee through the filter into the top chamber.  </p>

		<div class="text-container"> 
		<img src="images/TI.jpg" alt="Small rounded tea infuser." class="image-right">
		</div>
		<h2> Tea</h2>
		<p>I personally used a little metal tea infuser as it is easy to use with your loose-leaf tea as that carries more flavor than tea bags. You simply fill the infuser with loose tea <br>
		leaves, place it in your cup, pour hot water over it, let it steep for about 5 minutes and enjoy.  </p>
        <div class="clear"></div>
		
		<div class="text-container"> 
		<img src="images/teapot.jpg" alt="Glass teapot with tea leaves floating in the water." class="image-right">
		</div>

        <p> Using any teapot, you will boil your water and then add your loose tea left into the teapot and then add your water, letting it steep for 5 minutes and then using a </br>
		tea strainer to place it on top of the teacup you will pour the tea. </p>
        <div class="clear"></div>
		
		<div class="text-container"> 
		<img src="images/ITP.jpg" alt="Glass teapot with insfire. " class="image-right">
		</div>
		
		<p>Lastly, I had a Teapot that was from Ikea. Itcame with an infusere and that also saved much time from the previous two methods as it was convenient to have two things in one.  </p>

           <h2> Coffee Creamers/ Bottled Coffee</h2>
		   
		<p> I will share here my favorite coffee creamers that I have used in my coffee and recomend.</p>
		 
		 <div class="text-container"> 
		<img src="images/pc.jpg" alt="Coffee creamer, white bottlewith blue cap." class="image-right">
		</div>
		
		
		 <p> <strong>Barissimo Coffee-Pumpkin Spice </strong>
		   I like this coffee creamer its the perfect amount of milk and is not too sweet to add on your coffee.<br>
		   The pumpkin is not so overly in your face and that also depends how much you add. I tendto add about 2 table sppons<br>
		   into my coffee.</p>
        <div class="clear"></div>

 
		  <div class="text-container"> 
		<img src="images/DCB.jpg" alt="Bottle with white wraper and coffee at the bottom." class="image-right">
		</div>
		<p><strong> Dunkin Cold Brew</strong> <br>
		I have tried this version of the dunkin coffee but it defenitly depends on what you add on <br>
		and how you prepare the coffee so that the taste is up to your own standars. I defenitly think there<br>
		needs to be some experimentation on your behalf. Also read the instructions on the bottle.</p>
       <div class="clear"></div>	   
	   
	   
	  <div class="text-container"> 
		<img src="images/CB.jpg" alt="Bottle with yellow wraping, purple and black on the packiging." class="image-right">
		</div>
		
		<p> <strong> Cafe Bustelo Espresso</strong>
		 This coffee in general their  brand is said to be on the more cafinated side, so this espresso<br>
		 was defenitly cafinated. I also had some experimentation with the taste and how much milk to put in the coffee.</p>
		 <div class="clear"></div>

		 <p><strong> Chobani- Coffee Creamers Review</strong>
		 <li>Cinnamon Coffee Cake - I absolutely love this creamer, it changes the taste  to my coffee as if I had added a syrup to it.
		  Anytime I make coffee for my family with this creamer they rave of it, so I defenitly think you should purchase it.</li>
         <div class="clear"></div>

		 
		 <div class="text-container"> 
		<img src="images/swc.jpg" alt="Purple bottle with black letters." class="image-right">
		</div>
		
		 <ul>
		 <li>Sweet Cream- I also love this creamer it defenitly sweeates up my coffee and I do use it more as a sweetner if I want my coffee
		 to be more acidic.</li>
		 <div class="clear"></div>
		 
		 <div class="text-container"> 
		<img src="images/wcr.jpg" alt="White bottle has pink in most with a rasperrie dipped in white chocolate." class="image-right">
		</div>
		
		 <li>White Chocolate Raspberry- I love, love this creamer, it changes my coffe up for the better, defenitly recomend if you like sweet things but its not
		   so overly there that it removes the taste of the coffee. I unfortunatly have not see this one in my grocery store but I 100% reccomend you try it out.</li>
        <div class="clear"></div>
		  
		  <div class="text-container"> 		 
		<img src="images/vc.jpg" alt="Blue bottle with the vanilla flower on it." class="image-right">
		</div>
		
		 <li>Vanilla- Ths one was good but it also was not much to it, I think would prefer buying the Sweet cream one over
		 the vanilla one.</li>
		  <div class="clear"></div>
		 		 <div class="text-container"> 
		<img src="images/wcm.jpg" alt="Blue bottle with white chocolate on the bottle." class="image-right">
		</div>
		
		 <li> White Chocalte Mocha- I also only bought this one once and the taste was good just did not fit my preference in coffee.</li>
		  <div class="clear"></div>
		  
		 <div class="text-container"> 
		<img src="images/zcc.jpg" alt="White vottle with green lettering." class="image-right">
		</div>
		
		 <li>Sweet Creamer-Zero Sugar- I will be honest I hated this creamer, I do think that if you like zero sugar<br>
		  things then you will love this creamer. To everyone that likes their sugar defenitly do not drink this. I honestly<br>
		  bought this just because I was curious but I could tatste the funny taste even with my coffee.</li>
		  
		  </ul>

		<h2> Recipies</h2>
		<p>As you all might have experienced the pandemic and if you were chronically online then you might have come across dalgona coffee. </p>

  <ol>
   <li>I start by adding my coffee in my cup and then add warm water, I do not use any measurements <br>
