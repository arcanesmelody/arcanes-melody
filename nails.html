	<h2>Nails</h2>
   <p>Welcome to the Nails section of Arcane’s Melody! Here, you will find recommendations for press-on nails, taking into <br>
   consideration my nail beds. I’ll share the products I use, where I find them, my thoughts on what I like, and tips on how to
   take care of your nails. </p>
   
   <p>To begin, I will show a picture of my nails with only Essie Hard to Resist applied. I will then explain my process <br>
   for applying a French set on my nails, including the dos and don’ts. I will also share pictures of different marks<br>
   on my nails taken on different days while wearing the French set, followed by a picture of my nails right after removing<br>
   the set. Finally, I will take a picture of my nails as they are right now. But first I will share how i apply my nails and<br>
   then move on to what was mentioned above. </br>
   
   
		
    <h2>Applying Nails </h2>
    <h3>Materials: </h3>
	<ul>
     <li>Nail set: I used Kiss Salon Acrylic French in the size Medium </li>
    <li>Essie Hard to Resist nail strengthener </li>
     <li>Nail clipper </li>
    <li>Cuticle pusher </li>
    <li>Kiss nail glue Mega Hold (any Kiss nail glue is good) </li>
   <li>Nail filer </li>
   <li>Acetone or alcohol wipes</li> 
   </ul>
 <h3>Steps: </h3>
  <ol>
  <li><strong>Trim Your Nails:</strong> Start by cutting your nails if they are long. Even if they are short, <br>
  it is better to have them trimmed to a manageable length. </li>
 <li><strong>Prepare the Press-Ons:</strong> Take the nails out of the packaging and ensure that the nails you <br>
 choose cover your entire nail bed without squishing your nails. Set them aside. </li>
<li><strong>Push Back Cuticles:</strong> Start pushing back your cuticles with a cuticle pusher and make sure <br>
to remove the dead cuticle. </li>
<li><strong>Cut the Cuticle: </strong>When cutting the cuticle, it should not hurt as you are only cutting the<br>
 dead skin with the nail clipper. This helps your press-ons last longer. </li>
<li><strong>File the Nails:</strong> File the top of your nails to allow the glue and the press-on nail to <br>
grip your natural nails better. </li>
<li><strong>Clean the Nail Beds: </strong>Clean all your nail beds with acetone or alcohol wipes to ensure<br>
 everything is clean. </li>
<li><strong>Optional Step:</strong> Apply a coat of Essie Hard to Resist to protect your nails. My nails<br>
last longer even with the Essie coat on. </li>
<li><strong>Apply the Glue:</strong> When you first start applying your nails, it may be difficult to<br>
 handle the glue as it dries quickly. Apply a thin layer on your natural nail and another on your press-on nail. </li>
<li><strong>Attach the Press-Ons:</strong> Make sure you are applying your nail at a 45-degree angle and that each <br>
corner is touching the other corner of your nail. Hold the press-on nail for about 30 seconds to ensure there are no air bubbles. </li>
</ol>

<h2>Press-On Nails: Application, Maintenance, and Removal </h2>

 <p>I usually buy my press-on nails from Family Dollar because they are cheaper. For example, the French set I was wearing cost $3 at Family <br>
 Dollar, but it was $8 at Walgreens. I recommend Walgreens nails as they have some with different rhinestones, depending on what they have in <br>
 stock and the Walgreens near you. Both Family Dollar and Walgreens sell Kiss nails, which I prefer to use. Walgreens has some more intricate <br>
 designs, but you might find the same ones from Walgreens at Family Dollar for a lower price. With my instructions, my nails usually last 10 days. <br>
 After 9-10 days, the area around the cuticle starts to look unflattering, and they feel like they might pop off. This depends on a person's nail growth, <br>
 as I have heard from people that press-on's can last a month or more, but the packaging recommends only wearing them for a week or seven days. I also<br>
 think you should consider that leaving press-ons on for a long time can still damage your nails, so please keep that in mind. </p>
<p>As you can see, when I applied my nails, there were some air bubbles. This is not good as it can allow water to stay between your nails<br>
 and the press-ons, leading to bacteria growth. <br>
You can also see that after some time, my nails lose their sharpness around the edges and become more rounded. You can definitely file them <br>
to keep them sharper. I personally do not mind, but this is also why I only tend to extend to 10 days. </p>
<p>This time, I lasted around 11 days with my nails on as I wanted to see how long they would last. While in the grocery store, I was carrying <br>
a pack of water bottles and lost a nail as I was putting it in the shopping cart. After that, I was able to pop off my nails by picking at one <br>
side of the nail to remove it. I do not recommend this as it damages your nails. The only reason I feel it was easy to remove them like this is<br>
 because I had the Essie coat underneath, and it was past the 10 days to remove my nails. </p>
 
<h2>Removing Nails </h2>
<p>I have seen many people use dish soap in warm water, adding oil, and then placing their hands in the mixture to allow the nails to be removed <br>
gently. They use a cuticle pusher to remove the nails. </p>
<p>Other people have also chosen to use acetone on their nails with cotton to allow for easier removal. </p>
