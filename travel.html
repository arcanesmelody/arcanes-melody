            <h2>Travel</h2>
            <p>Welcome to the Travel section of Arcane’s Melody! Here, you'll find tips and advice on how to
			travel on a budget, especially if you are a student. I will share my personal experiences of 
			traveling alone as a college student, including my trips to NYC. I used Southwest Airlines 
			for my travel, and I'll provide insights into my experiences with them. Additionally, I'll discuss 
			budget-friendly travel tips and how to make the most of your trips without breaking the bank.</p>
			
	<h2> Background </h2>
    <p>I have always wished to visit NYC, especially since I was 18. When I got my first “big girl job” through an internship at my college, <br>
	I wanted to treat myself as a belated happy 18th/19th birthday gift. I looked up prices on Google and checked what fit my schedule and budget. <br>
	Most prices were $200 or more, which was out of my budget. I came across Southwest Airlines, and their prices were reasonable for a college student<br>
	on a budget. The downside is that certain days are more expensive than others, and sometimes the flights don't match your schedule. However, overall,<br>
	their prices are better than other airlines on the market. As mentioned, I am only a college student and do not have much money to spend, so I had to improvise.</p>
   <p>During the summer of 2024, I secured an internship at my college. My work week was 4 hours a day, 20 hours a week, with a pay rate of $17.00 an hour.<br>
   You can imagine that I was on a very tight budget and needed to be cost-effective with expenses such as airfare, hotel/hostel stay, food, and any other<br>
   spending. I started looking at times when the airline had cheaper flights and then at my own schedule. I also had to ensure that my paycheck would align<br>
   with my previous two concerns. I managed to get a flight that would leave on September 6, 2024, at around 6 am, departing from Chicago MDW airport to<br>
   NYC LaGuardia airport. </p>
   <p>I will add my itinerary with pictures to show what I did and any screenshots I took of the flight costs and anything else I bought in NYC. Please<br>
   note that this is my only trip at the moment, but I will be traveling more in the future when I save up. </p>
   
   <h2>Choosing a Flight</h2>
    <p>Deciding to choose a flight was difficult as I was still working at my college for the internship and my Fall semester was almost about to begin. <br>
	Southwest Airlines allows you to look at their calendar with the dates and prices labeled on each date. I found that September 6th was the most convenient<br>
	time. Thankfully, I was taken to the airport and did not need to spend money traveling to Midway Airport. As it was an early flight, I had breakfast at the<br>
	airport: yogurt with fruit and a water bottle. <br>
    I only had a backpack, so no checked bag.</p>
			
	<h2>Landing and Traveling to the Hostel</h2> 
    <p>Right after landing, I followed the instructions at the airport and found my way downstairs to the buses that would take me to the subway.<br>
	I was nervous as I thought I would need to pay to get on the bus, but I was pleasantly surprised to know that the ride was free. I followed my <br>
	instructions on Google Maps, got lost, but eventually found my way to the hostel and left my bag so that I would only carry a handbag.</p>
